AS THE MOON BURNED BRIGHT ABOVE,
WITH THE DESERT STRETCHING BEHIND ME,
AFTER I DOUBLE-CHECKED MY MAP,
MY LIPS CRACKED AND COVERED IN SAND,
WITH FATE GUIDING MY EVERY MOVE,
PUTTING THE FADED PHOTO IN MY POCKET,
AS I RECALLED MY FATHER'S LAST WORDS,
MY MEMORY SLIPPING AWAY FROM ME,
I STRODE VALIANTLY TOWARD MY DESTINY,
I SQUEEZED THE WHIP AT MY SIDE,
I DRAINED THE REST OF MY CANTEEN,
I SPOTTED THE CAVE'S ENTRANCE,
I FURROWED MY BROW,
I PAID MY BEDOUIN GUIDE,
I DISMOUNTED MY CAMEL,
I SQUINTED INTO THE DARKNESS,
AND THOUGHT OF HER ONE LAST TIME.
AND HELD MY HAT AGAINST THE WIND.
AND A COLD CHILL TOOK HOLD OF ME.
AND WONDERED HOW LONG I'D BE BELOW.
AND VOWED TO RETURN VICTORIOUS.
AND SWORE I HEARD VOICES UP AHEAD.
AND FELT THE GODS SMILING UPON ME.
AND THAT'S WHEN IT ALL STARTED.
